# manager

This application will deal with the development of a marine management support infor-
mation system. The final product will be a web application created with the
VueJS tool. Our solution will digitize the marina management process. We
will solve the problem of arranging or repairing moorings, storing information
about the current state of the marina and also the possibility of purchasing
or booking them. For an improved user experience, we will add an inter-
nal forum for communication between clients within the marina to the app.
We will use Amazon web services, Google maps API, Bootstrap and other
Vue components in the production.
